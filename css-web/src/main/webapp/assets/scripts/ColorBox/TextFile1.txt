// Format:
$(selector).colorbox({key:value, key:value, key:value});
// Examples:
// Image links displayed as a group
$('a.gallery').colorbox({rel:'gal'});

// Ajax
$('a#login').colorbox();

// Called directly, without assignment to an element:
$.colorbox({href:"thankyou.html"});

// Called directly with HTML
$.colorbox({html:"<h1>Welcome</h1>"});

// Colorbox can accept a function in place of a static value:
$("a.gallery").colorbox({rel: 'gal', title: function(){
  var url = $(this).attr('href');
  return '<a href="' + url + '" target="_blank">Open In New Window</a>';
}});

Settings
Property	Default	Description
transition	"elastic"	The transition type. Can be set to "elastic", "fade", or "none".
speed	350	Sets the speed of the fade and elastic transitions, in milliseconds.
href	false	This can be used as an alternative anchor URL or to associate a URL for non-anchor elements such as images or form buttons. $("h1").colorbox({href:"welcome.html"});
title	false	This can be used as an anchor title alternative for Colorbox.
rel	false	This can be used as an anchor rel alternative for Colorbox. This allows the user to group any combination of elements together for a gallery, or to override an existing rel so elements are not grouped together. $("a.gallery").colorbox({rel:"group1"}); Note: The value can also be set to 'nofollow' to disable grouping.
scalePhotos	true	If true, and if maxWidth, maxHeight, innerWidth, innerHeight, width, or height have been defined, Colorbox will scale photos to fit within the those values.
scrolling	true	If false, Colorbox will hide scrollbars for overflowing content. This could be used on conjunction with the resize method (see below) for a smoother transition if you are appending content to an already open instance of Colorbox.
opacity	0.85	The overlay opacity level. Range: 0 to 1.
open	false	If true, Colorbox will immediately open.
returnFocus	true	If true, focus will be returned when Colorbox exits to the element it was launched from.
trapFocus	true	If true, keyboard focus will be limited to Colorbox's navigation and content.
fastIframe	true	If false, the loading graphic removal and onComplete event will be delayed until iframe's content has completely loaded.
preloading	true	Allows for preloading of 'Next' and 'Previous' content in a group, after the current content has finished loading. Set to false to disable.
overlayClose	true	If false, disables closing Colorbox by clicking on the background overlay.
escKey	true	If false, will disable closing colorbox on 'esc' key press.
arrowKey	true	If false, will disable the left and right arrow keys from navigating between the items in a group.
loop	true	If false, will disable the ability to loop back to the beginning of the group when on the last element.
data	false	For submitting GET or POST values through an ajax request. The data property will act exactly like jQuery's .load() data argument, as Colorbox uses .load() for ajax handling.
className	false	Adds a given class to colorbox and the overlay.
fadeOut	300	Sets the fadeOut speed, in milliseconds, when closing Colorbox.
closeButton	true	Set to false to remove the close button.
Internationalization		
current	"image {current} of {total}"	Text or HTML for the group counter while viewing a group. {current} and {total} are detected and replaced with actual numbers while Colorbox runs.
previous	"previous"	Text or HTML for the previous button while viewing a group.
next	"next"	Text or HTML for the next button while viewing a group.
close	"close"	Text or HTML for the close button. The 'esc' key will also close Colorbox.
xhrError	"This content failed to load."	Error message given when ajax content for a given URL cannot be loaded.
imgError	"This image failed to load."	Error message given when a link to an image fails to load.
Content Type		
iframe	false	If true, specifies that content should be displayed in an iFrame.
inline	false	
If true, content from the current document can be displayed by passing the href property a jQuery selector, or jQuery object.

// Using a selector:
$("#inline").colorbox({inline:true, href:"#myForm"});

// Using a jQuery object:
var $form = $("#myForm");
$("#inline").colorbox({inline:true, href:$form});
html	false	For displaying a string of HTML or text: $.colorbox({html:"<p>Hello</p>"});
photo	false	If true, this setting forces Colorbox to display a link as a photo. Use this when automatic photo detection fails (such as using a url like 'photo.php' instead of 'photo.jpg')
ajax		This property isn't actually used as Colorbox assumes all hrefs should be treated as either ajax or photos, unless one of the other content types were specified.
Dimensions		
width	false	Set a fixed total width. This includes borders and buttons. Example: "100%", "500px", or 500
height	false	Set a fixed total height. This includes borders and buttons. Example: "100%", "500px", or 500
innerWidth	false	This is an alternative to 'width' used to set a fixed inner width. This excludes borders and buttons. Example: "50%", "500px", or 500
innerHeight	false	This is an alternative to 'height' used to set a fixed inner height. This excludes borders and buttons. Example: "50%", "500px", or 500
initialWidth	300	Set the initial width, prior to any content being loaded.
initialHeight	100	Set the initial height, prior to any content being loaded.
maxWidth	false	Set a maximum width for loaded content. Example: "100%", 500, "500px"
maxHeight	false	Set a maximum height for loaded content. Example: "100%", 500, "500px"
Slideshow		
slideshow	false	If true, adds an automatic slideshow to a content group / gallery.
slideshowSpeed	2500	Sets the speed of the slideshow, in milliseconds.
slideshowAuto	true	If true, the slideshow will automatically start to play.
slideshowStart	"start slideshow"	Text for the slideshow start button.
slideshowStop	"stop slideshow"	Text for the slideshow stop button
Positioning		
fixed	false	If true, Colorbox will be displayed in a fixed position within the visitor's viewport. This is unlike the default absolute positioning relative to the document.
top	false	Accepts a pixel or percent value (50, "50px", "10%"). Controls Colorbox's vertical positioning instead of using the default position of being centered in the viewport.
bottom	false	Accepts a pixel or percent value (50, "50px", "10%"). Controls Colorbox's vertical positioning instead of using the default position of being centered in the viewport.
left	false	Accepts a pixel or percent value (50, "50px", "10%"). Controls Colorbox's horizontal positioning instead of using the default position of being centered in the viewport.
right	false	Accepts a pixel or percent value (50, "50px", "10%"). Controls Colorbox's horizontal positioning instead of using the default position of being centered in the viewport.
reposition	true	Repositions Colorbox if the window's resize event is fired.
Retina Images		
retinaImage	false	If true, Colorbox will scale down the current photo to match the screen's pixel ratio
retinaUrl	false	If true and the device has a high resolution display, Colorbox will replace the current photo's file extention with the retinaSuffix+extension
retinaSuffix	"@2x.$1"	If retinaUrl is true and the device has a high resolution display, the href value will have it's extention extended with this suffix. For example, the default value would change `my-photo.jpg` to `my-photo@2x.jpg`
Callbacks		
onOpen	false	Callback that fires right before Colorbox begins to open.
onLoad	false	Callback that fires right before attempting to load the target content.
onComplete	false	Callback that fires right after loaded content is displayed.
onCleanup	false	Callback that fires at the start of the close process.
onClosed	false	Callback that fires once Colorbox is closed.
Public Methods
$.colorbox()	This method allows you to call Colorbox without having to assign it to an element. $.colorbox({href:"login.php"});
$.colorbox.next()
$.colorbox.prev()	These methods moves to the next and previous items in a group and are the same as pressing the 'next' or 'previous' buttons.
$.colorbox.close()	This method initiates the close sequence, which does not immediately complete. The lightbox will be completely closed only when the cbox_closed event / onClosed callback is fired.
$.colorbox.element()	This method is used to fetch the current HTML element that Colorbox is associated with. Returns a jQuery object containing the element. var $element = $.colorbox.element();
$.colorbox.resize()	This allows Colorbox to be resized based on it's own auto-calculations, or to a specific size. This must be called manually after Colorbox's content has loaded. The optional parameters object can accept width or innerWidth and height or innerHeight. Without specifying a width or height, Colorbox will attempt to recalculate the height of it's current content.
$.colorbox.remove()	Removes all traces of Colorbox from the document. Not the same as $.colorbox.close(), which tucks colorbox away for future use.
Event Hooks
These event hooks fire at the same time as their corresponding callbacks (ie. cbox_complete & onComplete), but can be used to make a universal change to Colorbox, while callbacks are only applied to selected elements.

// Example of using an event listener and public method to build a primitive slideshow:
$(document).bind('cbox_complete', function(){
  setTimeout($.colorbox.next, 1500);
});
cbox_open	triggers when Colorbox is first opened, but after a few key variable assignments take place.
cbox_load	triggers at the start of the phase where content type is determined and loaded.
cbox_complete	triggers when the transition has completed and the newly loaded content has been revealed.
cbox_cleanup	triggers as the close method begins.
cbox_closed	triggers as the close method ends.
